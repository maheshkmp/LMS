I am currently working on this individual project, engaging in self-learning to design a Learning Management System (LMS) tailored for school students, parents, and teachers. The project utilizes Python and Django for backend development, while HTML5 and CSS are employed for frontend design. Throughout this endeavor, I am focusing on incorporating best practices and concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure robust and efficient system architecture.
